PROBLEM STATEMENT ----> Real-Time Public Transport Tracking for Small Cities
############################### DESCRIPTION ##############################
🚍 Chikkaballapur Public Transport Tracking System

This project is a real-time public bus tracking system built for small cities like Chikkaballapur.
It simulates buses moving along actual city routes and displays their live locations, ETA (Estimated Time of Arrival), and assigned routes on an interactive map.

👉Backend: Flask API to store and serve live bus data

👉Frontend: Leaflet.js map showing buses, routes, and ETA

👉Simulator: Python script (gps_sim.py) generating real-time bus movements along defined routes

The goal is to provide affordable, scalable, and practical transport tracking for small towns where GPS-enabled tracking is often unavailable.

😎IF YOU WANNA CLONE THIS , HERE'S THE WAY 😎 :
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
# Install backend requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Run backend
python app.py
# In another terminal, run GPS simulator
python gps_sim.py
# Open index.html in browser

---------------------- Usage --------------------
Run backend first (app.py)
Run simulator (gps_sim.py) to generate live bus data
Open index.html in a browser → view buses moving in real-time

➡️ NOTE : 
We have used just 3 routes and 6 buses as this is a prototype . Further can be added very easily as our repo is much flexible . And real time gps connectivity can added easily by authorized users .

THANK YOU 😊
